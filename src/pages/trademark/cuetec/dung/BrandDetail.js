      <p className="brand-detail-desc">
        The Cuetec cue burst onto the scene in 1989 as a new concept in pool cues. The basic premise was a cue, using a patented process, with a Grade A Plus North American maple shaft covered with a thin layer of fiberglass or graphite, that would stay straight in any adverse conditions, be extremely resistant to damage from the rigors of any style of play, be easy to maintain, and most importantly, offer true professional quality and playability at a price that virtually anyone could afford.
      </p>
      <p className="brand-detail-desc">
        Since then, Cuetec has continued to be the highest quality and most professional cue available on the market. Cuetec has won hundreds of tournaments to prove it.
